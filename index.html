        Hello! Welcome to my portfolio, below is a selection of my completed software development and data engineering projects.<br>
        I am currently studying software development and data science at AUT.<br>
        I am looking for internship and career opportunities in backend development and data engineering.<br>
        ~<br>
        In my spare time I enjoy Photography, Tramping and DnD. A selection of my favorite photos are available on the photography page above.

      <p>
        For a university project I developed a version of PONG in embedded C++ which ran on a pair of Arduino Nano microcontrollers. I designed and assembled a PCB to connect peripheral devices to the microcontrollers. <br>
        This project was significantly beyond the scope of the university assignment. I chose it specifically to challenge myself to learn outside the box.<br>
        Due to the video buffer taking up the majority of the 2KB available ram, the game was split between two microcontrollers. One of which handled video output while the other processed game logic and managed IO for the controllers, score counters, and audio.

        For a university project I designed and implemented a database for a course enrolment application. I wrote the backend for the application
        which integrated the database with the GUI. Integration was done using JavaDB. The GUI was implemented by a team partner.

      <p>
        As an exercise to learn C# multithreading I created an application which applies a visual effect to a bitmap.<br>
        The application first generates a contrast mask from the given image where all pixels exceeding a given brightness
        threshold are white and all others are black.<br>
        Contiguous lines of image pixels matching white pixels in the contrast mask are placed into groups and added to a queue to be sorted.<br>
        In a separate thread these groups are sorted by either hue, saturation, or luminance, then placed back into the image.

      <p>
        A team and I recreated a scene from the Stanley Parable in Unity. I was responsible for texturing of rooms and 3D models as well as lighting design for the scene. <br>I unwrapped models in Blender and textured them with a combination of hand painting in photoshop and samples taken from photographs.

        <h4>Maze Solving Algorithm and Animation</h4> <div class="grade">Grade: 100%</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This project represents a maze as a graph where each node holds connections to up to two other nodes.<br>
        Maze solving is implemented using a recursive depth first search of the graph.<br> 
        This algorithm is slowed for display as an animation which runs in a separate thread. 
        Without delays it completes in approximately 1ms.

      <p>
        While I was teaching myself python I made a number of arcade style video games including the above asteroid dodging game.<br>
        I also used these projects to learn pixel art and Aseprite.
